# Ticely Tacely Toe (TS style)

This is an very ordinary tic tac toe game. It is built following the youtube React tutorial from freecodecamp:

The first iteration was built in React native. But following our class transending into the world of Next.js alongside with Typescript we got an assignment to refactor an existing project to Typescript.


## Installation

If you fork this repo and want to build on to the existing project follow these instructions: 

- run: `npm install` in the root
- then run: `npm run dev` to start the application

## The backend side of things

The application makes use of Firebase to handle the small backend. The backend keeps tracks of the scorelist and the relationship between a username and its score.
